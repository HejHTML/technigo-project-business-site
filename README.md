# Business Site

My business site with courses in health promotion.
I used what I know as a teacher of health and communication and made the site about coaching courses.

Description of the assignment
Worked with html, css, got some help from chat gpt with a little JS for a hamburger-button/menu. The JS went fine to add, but the html and css ate my energy today. I probably should have went for a run and come back later to finish it. But I'm eager to find out whats next in this course. I try to test my skills by correcting everything I've written and change code to see that I understand which element does what on the site.

A lot of time was spent on making it responsive and I have been researching that in other sites and compared whats best/looks good. I've understood JS will make the responsive side better, chatgpt was very persistant that I should use it. But I want to learn what it is from Technigo first. :)

- If you had more time, what would be next?
I saw that h1 could be a bit more responsive and adapt to different sceens, but I struggled with this site for a while and now I know a lot more - even though I left some to ask for. I want to be better at design and I will continue updating this site to make it nicer.
